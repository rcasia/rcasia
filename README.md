ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Rico, a software engineer immersed in Java and microservices. My focus? Crafting resilient systems through reactive programming.

ðŸš€ When not at work, I'm in neovim plugin territoryâ€”check out neotest-java and neotest-bash. They're my passion projects, elevating testing in the developer's realm.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm navigating Rust, absorbing best practices, and reading some articles.

Let's shape the future of software together! ðŸ”§
